git:

version control management tool 

"commits" are snapshots of a previous version of code.
you only make commits when you have working code. 

when i want to copy  existing code from a repository, i would git clone <repo link>

when i want to start a new repository, i would get init

when i want to put files in my repository, i would git add "filename" or "--all"

when i want to save all my files in the repository, i would git commit -m "git msg here" 

git remote add origin( or anything) "link of repository" 

git push

git push origin ( or what you named it)
